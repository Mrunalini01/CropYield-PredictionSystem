The proposed system is a crop yield predictor that takes into consideration the weather conditions like temperature and rainfall and other factors like crop, area and location. 
In this system, machine learning methods are applied to predict 3 most consumed crops in Maharashtra using publicly available data. 
It uses a supervised learning method to form the model and predict the output. 
The proposed system can be described by the stages like data set collection, data pre-processing, split the data into training and test data, applying the algorithms and prediction of output.
The data is collected and it is split into training data and test data in the ratio of 80% and 20% respectively. Algorithms used are Decision tree regressor, Gradient boosting regressor, Random Forest regressor and support vector machine and based on the evaluation metric the best suitable algorithm is selected. After that the model is trained and used for prediction of output.
